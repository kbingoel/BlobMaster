"""
Training package for BlobMaster.

This package contains the AlphaZero-style training pipeline for the Blob card game AI:
- Self-play game generation
- Replay buffer for experience storage
- Training loop orchestration
- Model evaluation and ELO tracking

Main Components:
    - SelfPlayWorker: Generates training games using MCTS (IMPLEMENTED - Phase 4 Session 1)
    - SelfPlayEngine: Parallelizes self-play across multiple workers (IMPLEMENTED - Phase 4 Session 2)
    - ReplayBuffer: Stores and samples training examples (IMPLEMENTED - Phase 4 Session 3)
    - NetworkTrainer: Updates neural network weights (TODO - Session 4)
    - TrainingPipeline: Orchestrates the full training loop (TODO - Session 5)
