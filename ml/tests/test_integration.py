Integration tests for Phase 2: MCTS + Neural Network

Tests the complete pipeline from game state → encoding → neural network →
MCTS → action selection → game update.

Tests cover:
- End-to-end game playing with MCTS agents
- Performance benchmarks against targets
- Quality validation (MCTS vs random baseline)
- Legal action validation
