Integration tests for imperfect information handling in Phase 3.

This module contains integration tests that validate the complete Phase 3
implementation, including belief tracking, determinization, and imperfect
information MCTS working together.

Test Coverage:
    - Complete game playthrough with imperfect info MCTS
    - Belief tracking throughout game lifecycle
    - Performance benchmarks for Phase 3 targets
    - Memory usage validation
    - Backward compatibility with Phase 2
