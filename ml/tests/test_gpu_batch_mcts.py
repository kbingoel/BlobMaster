Tests for GPU-Batched MCTS Implementation

This module tests the GPU-batched parallel expansion feature for MCTS,
which enables cross-worker batching for maximum GPU utilization.

Test Coverage:
    1. Correctness: search_parallel() produces similar results to search()
    2. Virtual Loss: Parallel expansion uses virtual loss mechanism correctly
    3. Batch Size: Evaluations are batched across workers
    4. Performance: Parallel expansion improves throughput
    5. Integration: Works with both BatchedEvaluator and GPUServerClient

Expected Results:
    - Policy quality within 5% of sequential MCTS
    - Batch sizes achieve 256-1024 with 32 workers × 10 expansions
    - 5-10x speedup over baseline self-play
