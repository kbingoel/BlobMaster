"""
State encoding for neural network input.

This module provides classes to encode game states into tensor representations
suitable for neural network processing, and to create legal action masks.

State Encoding Dimensions (256 total):
======================================

1. My Hand (52-dim binary):
   - One-hot encoding: 1 if I have this card, 0 otherwise
   - Ordered by suit (♠♥♣♦) then rank (2-A)

2. Cards Played This Trick (52-dim sequential):
   - 0 if not played in current trick
   - 1-8 for play order (which player position played it)

3. All Cards Played This Round (52-dim binary):
   - 1 if card has been played in any trick this round, 0 otherwise

4. Player Bids (8-dim, padded):
   - Normalized bid value for each player position
   - -1 for absent players or players who haven't bid yet

5. Player Tricks Won (8-dim, padded):
   - Normalized tricks won for each player position
   - 0 for absent players

6. My Bid (1-dim scalar):
   - Normalized bid value (-1 if not yet bid)

7. My Tricks Won (1-dim scalar):
   - Normalized tricks won

8. Round Metadata (8-dim):
   - Cards dealt this round (normalized)
   - Current trick number (normalized)
   - My position relative to dealer (normalized)
   - Number of active players (normalized)
   - Trump suit (one-hot: 4-dim for ♠♥♣♦, all zeros for None)
   - Am I the dealer? (binary)

9. Bidding Constraint (1-dim):
   - Is forbidden bid calculation active for me? (binary)

10. Game Phase (3-dim one-hot):
    - [bidding, playing_trick, scoring]

11. Positional Encoding (16-dim):
    - Additional features for position awareness
    - Relative position to current lead player
    - Cards remaining in hand
    - Rounds completed
    - etc.

Total: 52 + 52 + 52 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 3 + 16 = 202 base dimensions
Padded to 256 with zeros for future extensibility (54 dimensions spare)

Architecture Decision: State Vector Dimensions
----------------------------------------------
- 202 required dimensions + 54 spare = 26% padding overhead (optimal efficiency)
- 2x less memory per state vector (1KB)
- 4x fewer parameters in embedding layer vs larger alternatives (65K)
- Optimized for CPU inference on Intel laptop (deployment target)
- Better cache utilization (fits in L1/L2 cache)
- Power-of-2 size for optimal hardware memory alignment
- Compact model footprint (~2-3M parameters)

Card Index Mapping (0-51):
--------------------------
- 0-12: ♠ (Spades) 2-A
- 13-25: ♥ (Hearts) 2-A
- 26-38: ♣ (Clubs) 2-A
- 39-51: ♦ (Diamonds) 2-A
