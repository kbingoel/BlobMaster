"""
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation for Blob card game.

This module implements the AlphaZero-style MCTS algorithm that integrates
with a neural network for leaf evaluation and action selection. The MCTS
search performs lookahead planning by simulating games and building a
search tree guided by the neural network's policy and value predictions.

Main Components:
    - MCTS: Main search class that orchestrates simulations
    - Four-phase MCTS loop: Selection, Expansion, Evaluation, Backpropagation
    - Terminal state handling for completed games
    - Legal action masking for both bidding and playing phases

Example:
    >>> from ml.mcts import MCTS, MCTSNode
    >>> from ml.network import BlobNet, StateEncoder, ActionMasker
    >>> from ml.game.blob import BlobGame
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize components
    >>> network = BlobNet()
    >>> encoder = StateEncoder()
    >>> masker = ActionMasker()
    >>> mcts = MCTS(network, encoder, masker, num_simulations=100)
    >>>
    >>> # Create game and get action probabilities
    >>> game = BlobGame(num_players=4)
    >>> game.setup_round(cards_to_deal=5)
    >>> player = game.players[0]
    >>>
    >>> # Run MCTS search
    >>> action_probs = mcts.search(game, player)
    >>> # Returns: {0: 0.1, 1: 0.3, 2: 0.6} - probabilities for each legal action
    >>>
    >>> # Select best action
    >>> best_action = max(action_probs, key=action_probs.get)

    Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation for Blob card game.

    Integrates with neural network for leaf evaluation and uses UCB1-based

    The search performs N simulations, each consisting of:
        1. Selection: Traverse tree using UCB1 until reaching a leaf
        2. Expansion: Create children for legal actions with network policy priors

class ImperfectInfoMCTS:
    """
    Monte Carlo Tree Search for imperfect information games.

    Uses determinization to handle hidden opponent hands by sampling multiple
    possible worlds consistent with observations, running MCTS on each, and
    aggregating results.

    Multi-World MCTS Algorithm:
        1. Generate N determinizations (sampled opponent hands)
        2. For each determinization:
            - Run MCTS with K simulations
            - Get action visit counts
        3. Aggregate visit counts across all determinizations
        4. Select action based on aggregated counts

    Key Insight:
        - Running MCTS on multiple possible worlds averages out uncertainty
        - Actions that are good across many scenarios are more robust
        - Equivalent to doing expectation over belief distribution

    Attributes:
        network: Neural network for evaluation
        encoder: StateEncoder for converting game state to tensor
        masker: ActionMasker for creating legal action masks
        num_determinizations: Number of worlds to sample (default: 5)
        simulations_per_determinization: MCTS simulations per world (default: 50)
        c_puct: Exploration constant for UCB1
        temperature: Temperature for action selection

    Example:
