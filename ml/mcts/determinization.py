Determinization sampling for imperfect information MCTS.

This module implements determinization - the process of sampling consistent
opponent hands to convert an imperfect information game into multiple perfect
information game states. This enables standard MCTS to be applied by running
searches on multiple determinized worlds and aggregating results.

Determinization Sampling Strategy:

Goal: Generate complete game states where opponent hands are revealed
      in a way that's consistent with all observations and constraints.

Approach: Constraint Satisfaction Sampling
    1. Start with unseen card pool
    2. For each opponent:
        - Filter cards to only those they can have (constraints)
        - Sample N cards randomly from filtered pool
        - Remove sampled cards from pool
    3. Validate consistency (all constraints satisfied)
    4. Repeat if inconsistent

Challenges:
    - Sampling must respect suit constraints
    - Must handle cases where constraints are tight
    - Need to avoid over-sampling from limited pools

Optimizations:
    - Rejection sampling with early termination
    - Constraint propagation to reduce search space
    - Caching of valid samples

Quality Metrics:
    - Sample diversity (avoid always sampling same hands)
    - Constraint satisfaction rate (% of samples valid)
    - Sampling speed (<10ms per sample)

class Determinizer:

    Samples consistent opponent hands for determinization in MCTS.

    Generates complete game states by assigning cards to opponent hands
    in a way that satisfies all constraints from belief tracking.

    The determinizer uses rejection sampling with constraint checking to
    efficiently generate valid hand assignments. It supports both uniform
    and probability-weighted sampling based on belief state distributions.
