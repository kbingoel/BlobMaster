# BlobNet Training Performance - Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Diagnostic tools ready, awaiting benchmark results

## What We've Built

### 1. Comprehensive Diagnostic Suite

Four powerful tools to systematically diagnose training performance:

#### [`ml/benchmark_diagnostic.py`](ml/benchmark_diagnostic.py)
- **Purpose**: Systematic performance testing across configurations
- **Tests**: Worker scaling (4-128), batching strategies, parallelism types
- **Metrics**: Games/min, GPU utilization, batch sizes, memory usage
- **Duration**: ~30-40 minutes for full suite
- **Output**: CSV/JSON data with detailed metrics

#### [`ml/visualize_diagnostic.py`](ml/visualize_diagnostic.py)
- **Purpose**: Visual analysis of benchmark results
- **Creates**: Worker scaling plots, batching comparisons, efficiency analysis
- **Output**: PNG charts + console recommendations
- **Requires**: Results from benchmark_diagnostic.py

#### [`ml/profile_selfplay.py`](ml/profile_selfplay.py)
- **Purpose**: Code-level profiling to identify bottlenecks
- **Methods**: cProfile, manual timing, overhead analysis
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **Output**: Profile data (.prof files) + console analysis

#### [`ml/run_full_diagnostics.py`](ml/run_full_diagnostics.py)
- **Purpose**: Master script that runs all diagnostics
- **Duration**: ~40-50 minutes total
- **Output**: Complete diagnostic suite + summary

## Current Status: Awaiting Benchmark Results

We've completed the **diagnostic infrastructure**. Now we need to **run the benchmarks** to get data-driven answers.

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **What worker count saturates the GPU?**
   - Hypothesis: Need 32-128 workers (vs current 4)
   - Target: >70% GPU utilization

2. **Does batching help or hurt?**
   - At 4 workers: Likely hurts (overhead > benefit)
   - At 64+ workers: Should help significantly
   - Need data to confirm

3. **What's the realistic training timeline?**
   - Current: 196 days (unacceptable)
   - Target: <30 days
   - Achievable: Depends on findings

4. **Where are the actual bottlenecks?**
   - Network calls? Queue operations? Game logic?
   - Profiling will reveal truth

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Run Quick Validation (5-10 minutes)

Verify the diagnostic tools work:

```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe ml/test_diagnostic_quick.py
```

**Expected output**:
- 2 configurations tested (4 and 16 workers)
- GPU utilization measured
- Scaling factor calculated
- Confirmation that tools work

### Step 2: Run Full Diagnostic Suite (30-50 minutes)

Get comprehensive performance data:

```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe ml/run_full_diagnostics.py
```

**What it does**:
1. Profiles code to find bottlenecks (~10 min)
2. Runs comprehensive benchmarks (~30 min)
3. Generates visualizations
4. Provides recommendations

**Important**: This will fully utilize your GPU for 30-50 minutes. Plan accordingly!

### Step 3: Analyze Results (15-30 minutes)

Review the generated files:

1. **Look at PNG charts**:
   - `benchmark_worker_scaling.png` - Most important!
   - `benchmark_batching_comparison.png`
   - `benchmark_game_complexity.png`

2. **Read recommendations**:
   - Console output from `visualize_diagnostic.py`
   - Look for optimal worker count
   - Note GPU utilization at different scales

3. **Check detailed data**:
   - `benchmark_diagnostic_results.csv` - All metrics
   - `benchmark_diagnostic_results.json` - Detailed breakdown

### Step 4: Make Decision (Based on Data)

Use this decision tree:

```
IF GPU utilization < 70% at highest worker count tested:
    → Need more workers (try 128, 256)
    OR increase determinizations (3 → 10-16)

IF batching is slower than direct inference:
    → Disable BatchedEvaluator at low worker counts
    → Re-enable only when workers >= optimal threshold

IF games/min still < 500 at optimal config:
    → Consider reducing training scope:
        - 10k games/iter → 5k games/iter
        - 500 iterations → 300 iterations
    → OR implement Phase 1 of GPU-Batched MCTS (intra-game batching)

IF profiling shows unexpected bottleneck:
    → Address specific bottleneck before scaling further
```

### Step 5: Implement Fix (2-4 hours)

Based on findings, implement the fix:

**Option A: Simple Scaling** (if batching works)
```python
# Update ml/config.py or training scripts
config = {
    'num_workers': 64,  # Or optimal value from benchmarks
    'use_batched_evaluator': True,
    'batch_size': 1024,
    'batch_timeout_ms': 10.0,
    'use_thread_pool': True,
}
```

**Option B: Remove Batching** (if overhead dominates)
```python
config = {
    'num_workers': 32,  # Fewer workers needed without batching
    'use_batched_evaluator': False,
    'use_thread_pool': False,  # Use multiprocessing instead
}
```

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (if need more optimization)
- Implement Phase 1 of PLAN-GPUBatchedMCTS.md
- Add intra-game batching (virtual loss MCTS)
- Combine with cross-game batching

### Step 6: Validate Fix (10-20 minutes)

Re-run benchmarks with optimal config:

```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe ml/benchmark_diagnostic.py
```

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Games/min >500
- ✅ GPU utilization >70%
- ✅ Batch size >128 (if using batching)
- ✅ Training time estimate <30 days

---

## Expected Findings (Based on Analysis)

### Most Likely Scenario

**Finding**: GPU is starved for work due to insufficient parallelism

**Evidence**:
- 4 workers × ~4 requests/worker = 16 concurrent requests
- RTX 4060 needs 128-512 batch size for saturation
- Math shows need for 32-128 workers

**Solution**: Scale to 64-128 workers with ThreadPoolExecutor + BatchedEvaluator

**Expected result**:
- 500-1000 games/min (vs current 15-19)
- 70-90% GPU utilization (vs current 5-10%)
- 15-30 day training time (vs current 196 days)

### Alternative Scenarios

**Scenario 2**: Batching overhead exceeds benefit at low worker counts

**Evidence** (from Phase 3 results):
- Phase 2 (multiprocessing): 14.8 games/min
- Phase 3 (threading + batching): 8.9 games/min (40% SLOWER!)

**Solution**: Disable batching, use direct inference with more workers

**Scenario 3**: Unexpected bottleneck (game logic, determinization, etc.)

**Evidence**: Profiling shows non-network code dominating

**Solution**: Optimize specific bottleneck before scaling

## Integration with Phase 4

Once performance is acceptable:

### Continue Phase 4 Development

**Session 6**: Evaluation & ELO Tracking
- Model vs model tournaments
- ELO rating system
- Promotion threshold logic

**Session 7**: Main Training Script
- Configuration system
- Training orchestration
- Checkpointing and resuming

### Use Measured Performance for Planning

Update estimates in PLAN-Phase-4.md:

```python
# Before (assumed):
Self-play: ~300 games/min
Training time: ~15 days

# After (measured):
Self-play: {ACTUAL_GAMES_PER_MIN} games/min
Training time: {ACTUAL_DAYS} days
```

## If Things Go Wrong

### GPU utilization still low after scaling to 128 workers

**Try**:
- Increase determinizations: 3 → 10-16
- Increase simulations: 10 → 20-30
- Check if GPU is actually being used (nvidia-smi)
- Verify BatchedEvaluator is receiving requests

### Benchmarks are too slow

**Options**:
- Reduce num_games in benchmark (20 → 10)
- Test fewer worker counts (skip 8, 64)
- Use smaller network for benchmarking
- Run overnight

### Scripts have errors

**Common fixes**:
- Check CUDA is available: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
- Verify nvidia-smi works: `nvidia-smi`
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure venv is activated

### Results are confusing

**Get help**:
- Share the PNG visualizations
- Share CSV file
- Share profiling output
- Review FINDINGS-GPU-IDLE.md for context
