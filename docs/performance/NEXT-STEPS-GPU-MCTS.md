## Implementation Summary (Session 2025-10-26)

**Completed in this session:**

1. **Added `search_parallel()` method to MCTS class** ([ml/mcts/search.py:531-613](../../../ml/mcts/search.py#L531-L613))
   - Implements GPU-batched parallel tree expansion
   - Expands multiple leaves per iteration using virtual loss
   - Designed for cross-worker batching (32 workers × 10 leaves = 320 batch size)

2. **Added `_expand_parallel()` helper method** ([ml/mcts/search.py:615-658](../../../ml/mcts/search.py#L615-L658))
   - Core of GPU-batched MCTS
   - Selects batch_size leaves with virtual loss
   - Batches evaluation via shared evaluator

3. **Added `search_parallel()` to ImperfectInfoMCTS** ([ml/mcts/search.py:1056-1185](../../../ml/mcts/search.py#L1056-L1185))
   - Extends parallel expansion to imperfect information games
   - Combines determinization + parallel expansion + cross-worker batching
   - Expected: 32 workers × 3 determinizations × 10 leaves = 960 evaluations batched

4. **Updated SelfPlayWorker** ([ml/training/selfplay.py](../../../ml/training/selfplay.py))
   - Added `use_parallel_expansion` parameter
   - Added `parallel_batch_size` parameter (default: 10)
   - Updated get_bid() and get_card() callbacks to use search_parallel()

5. **Created comprehensive test suite** ([ml/tests/test_gpu_batch_mcts.py](../../../ml/tests/test_gpu_batch_mcts.py))
   - test_search_parallel_basic(): Basic functionality
   - test_search_parallel_vs_sequential(): Policy quality comparison
   - test_virtual_loss_mechanism(): Virtual loss correctness
   - test_batch_size_accumulation(): Cross-worker batching verification
   - test_imperfect_info_search_parallel(): Integration with determinization
   - test_fallback_without_evaluator(): Graceful degradation

6. **Created benchmark script** ([benchmarks/performance/benchmark_gpu_batch_mcts.py](../../../benchmarks/performance/benchmark_gpu_batch_mcts.py))
   - Benchmarks baseline, Phase 1, and GPU-batched configurations
   - Parameter sweep for optimal config discovery
   - Comparison mode for side-by-side evaluation
   - Saves results to CSV for analysis

**Key Infrastructure Already Present:**
- Virtual loss mechanism in MCTSNode (node.py:87-437)
- BatchedEvaluator for threading-based batching (batch_evaluator.py)
- GPUInferenceServer for multiprocessing-based batching (gpu_server.py)
- Existing search_batched() for intra-game batching (Phase 1)

**Next Steps:**
1. Run unit tests: `pytest ml/tests/test_gpu_batch_mcts.py -v`
2. Run quick benchmark: `python benchmarks/performance/benchmark_gpu_batch_mcts.py --compare --games 5`
3. Run parameter sweep: `python benchmarks/performance/benchmark_gpu_batch_mcts.py --sweep`
4. Run full validation: `python benchmarks/performance/benchmark_gpu_batch_mcts.py --compare --games 50`
5. Analyze results and decide on deployment if >=5x speedup achieved

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Achieve **5-10x speedup** in self-play performance through GPU-parallel MCTS tree expansion

**Current Performance**:
- Baseline: 32 games/min (Medium MCTS, 3×30 sims)
- Phase 1: 56 games/min (1.76x speedup) ⚠️ Insufficient

**Target Performance**:
- GPU-Batched MCTS: **160-320 games/min** (5-10x speedup) ✅
- Training time: **80 days → 8-16 days**

---

## Why GPU-Batched MCTS?

### Phase 1 Limitations (1.76x speedup)

**Problem**: Phase 1 batches neural network calls **within a single MCTS search**
- Batch sizes: 30-60 evaluations
- GPU underutilized: Needs 256-1024+ for efficiency
- Sequential tree traversal limits parallelism
- Overhead > benefit at small batch sizes

### GPU-Batched MCTS Solution (5-10x speedup)

**Approach**: Batch neural network calls **across multiple MCTS searches simultaneously**

**Key Insight**: Run multiple MCTS tree expansions in parallel, batch all leaf evaluations together

**Example**:
- 32 workers, each running MCTS with 3 determinizations
- Each determinization expands 10 leaves simultaneously
- Batch size: 32 × 3 × 10 = **960 evaluations** 🚀
- vs Phase 1: 30-60 evaluations 😞

### MCTS Tree Expansion (Per Worker)

**Current (Sequential)**:
```python
for sim in range(simulations_per_det):
    leaf = select_leaf(tree)  # Sequential traversal
    policy, value = network.evaluate(leaf.state)  # Individual call
    backpropagate(leaf, value)
```

**GPU-Batched (Parallel)**:
```python
# Expand multiple leaves simultaneously using virtual loss
leaves = []
for i in range(batch_size):  # e.g., 10 leaves
    leaf = select_leaf(tree)  # Apply virtual loss to block other threads
    leaves.append(leaf)

# Batch evaluate all leaves
states = [leaf.state for leaf in leaves]
policies, values = batch_evaluate(states)  # GPU batch call

# Backpropagate results and clear virtual losses
for leaf, policy, value in zip(leaves, policies, values):
    backpropagate(leaf, value)
    clear_virtual_loss(leaf)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Virtual Loss Mechanism
**File**: `ml/mcts/virtual_loss.py` (new)

**Purpose**: Allow multiple threads to explore tree simultaneously without collision

**Implementation**:
```python
class VirtualLoss:
    """Apply temporary losses to MCTS nodes during parallel exploration."""

    def __init__(self, loss_value: float = 1.0):
        self.loss_value = loss_value

    def apply(self, node: MCTSNode):
        """Apply virtual loss to node (makes it less attractive)."""
        node.visits += 1
        node.value_sum -= self.loss_value

    def clear(self, node: MCTSNode, actual_value: float):
        """Clear virtual loss and apply actual value."""
        node.value_sum += self.loss_value + actual_value
```

**Key Concepts**:
- Virtual loss = temporary penalty on node visits
- Prevents multiple threads from selecting same path
- Cleared after actual evaluation completes
- Standard in AlphaGo/AlphaZero implementations

**References**:
- AlphaGo paper: "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search"
- Virtual loss section: Parallel MCTS with Elo updates

#### 1.2 GPU Batch Evaluation Server
**File**: `ml/mcts/gpu_batch_server.py` (new)

**Purpose**: Centralized server to accumulate and batch neural network evaluation requests

**Implementation**:
```python
class GPUBatchEvaluationServer:
    """
    Centralized GPU batch evaluation server for MCTS workers.

    Accumulates evaluation requests from multiple workers/threads,
    batches them together, and submits single GPU forward pass.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        network: BlobNet,
        encoder: StateEncoder,
        device: str = "cuda",
        max_batch_size: int = 1024,
        timeout_ms: float = 5.0,
    ):
        self.network = network
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.device = device
        self.max_batch_size = max_batch_size
        self.timeout_ms = timeout_ms

        # Request queue
        self.queue = Queue()
        self.batch_worker = Thread(target=self._batch_loop, daemon=True)
        self.batch_worker.start()

    def evaluate(self, state: BlobGameState) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, float]:
        """
        Submit state for evaluation, blocks until result available.

        Returns:
            (policy, value): Action probabilities and value estimate
        """
        result_future = Future()
        self.queue.put((state, result_future))
        return result_future.result()  # Block until batch processed

    def _batch_loop(self):
        """Background thread that accumulates and processes batches."""
        while True:
            batch = self._accumulate_batch()
            if batch:
                self._process_batch(batch)

    def _accumulate_batch(self) -> List[Tuple[BlobGameState, Future]]:
        """
        Accumulate requests until:
        - max_batch_size reached, OR
        - timeout_ms elapsed since first request
        """
        batch = []
        deadline = time.time() + (self.timeout_ms / 1000.0)

        while len(batch) < self.max_batch_size and time.time() < deadline:
            try:
                item = self.queue.get(timeout=0.001)
                batch.append(item)
                if len(batch) == 1:
                    deadline = time.time() + (self.timeout_ms / 1000.0)
            except Empty:
                if batch:
                    break

        return batch

    def _process_batch(self, batch: List[Tuple[BlobGameState, Future]]):
        """Process batch of evaluation requests."""
        states = [item[0] for item in batch]
        futures = [item[1] for item in batch]

        # Encode states
        state_tensors = torch.stack([
            self.encoder.encode_state(s) for s in states
        ]).to(self.device)

        # Single forward pass
        with torch.no_grad():
            policy_logits, values = self.network(state_tensors)
            policies = torch.softmax(policy_logits, dim=-1).cpu().numpy()
            values = values.cpu().numpy()

        # Return results to futures
        for future, policy, value in zip(futures, policies, values):
            future.set_result((policy, value))
```

**Key Features**:
- Asynchronous request accumulation
- Timeout-based batching (5ms default)
- Max batch size limit (1024 default)
- Thread-safe queue
- Futures for result retrieval

#### 1.3 Parallel MCTS Tree Expansion
**File**: `ml/mcts/tree.py` (modify existing)

**Changes**:
1. Add virtual loss support to `MCTSNode`
2. Modify `select_leaf()` to apply virtual loss
3. Add `expand_parallel()` method for batch expansion

**New Method**:
```python
def expand_parallel(
    self,
    root: MCTSNode,
    batch_size: int,
    evaluator: GPUBatchEvaluationServer,
) -> None:
    """
    Expand multiple leaves in parallel using virtual loss.

    Args:
        root: Root node to expand from
        batch_size: Number of leaves to expand simultaneously
        evaluator: GPU batch evaluation server
    """
    # Step 1: Select batch_size leaves (apply virtual loss to each)
    leaves = []
    for i in range(batch_size):
        leaf = self.select_leaf(root, apply_virtual_loss=True)
        leaves.append(leaf)

    # Step 2: Batch evaluate all leaves
    states = [leaf.state for leaf in leaves]
    results = evaluator.evaluate_batch(states)  # Single GPU call

    # Step 3: Backpropagate and clear virtual losses
    for leaf, (policy, value) in zip(leaves, results):
        self.expand_node(leaf, policy)
        self.backpropagate(leaf, value, clear_virtual_loss=True)
```

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Update SelfPlayEngine
**File**: `ml/training/selfplay.py` (modify)

**Changes**:
1. Add `use_gpu_batch_server` parameter
2. Initialize `GPUBatchEvaluationServer` if enabled
3. Pass server to MCTS workers
4. Update worker to use parallel expansion

**Modified Initialization**:
```python
class SelfPlayEngine:
    def __init__(
        self,
        network: BlobNet,
        encoder: StateEncoder,
        masker: ActionMasker,
        num_workers: int = 32,
        # ... existing params ...
        use_gpu_batch_server: bool = False,  # NEW
        gpu_batch_size: int = 1024,         # NEW
        gpu_batch_timeout_ms: float = 5.0,  # NEW
    ):
        # ... existing init ...

        if use_gpu_batch_server:
            # Create centralized GPU server
            self.gpu_server = GPUBatchEvaluationServer(
                network=network,
                encoder=encoder,
                device=device,
                max_batch_size=gpu_batch_size,
                timeout_ms=gpu_batch_timeout_ms,
            )
        else:
            self.gpu_server = None
```

#### 2.2 Update MCTS Worker
**File**: `ml/training/selfplay.py` (modify `_worker_loop`)

**Changes**:
1. Check if GPU batch server enabled
2. Use parallel expansion if available
3. Fall back to sequential if not

**Modified Worker**:
```python
def _run_mcts(
    self,
    state: BlobGameState,
    num_simulations: int,
    gpu_server: Optional[GPUBatchEvaluationServer] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    """Run MCTS search to generate move probabilities."""

    mcts = MCTS(
        network=self.network,
        encoder=self.encoder,
        masker=self.masker,
        # ... params ...
    )

    if gpu_server is not None:
        # GPU-batched MCTS (parallel expansion)
        policy = mcts.search_parallel(
            state=state,
            num_simulations=num_simulations,
            batch_size=10,  # Expand 10 leaves per iteration
            evaluator=gpu_server,
        )
    else:
        # Standard sequential MCTS
        policy = mcts.search(state, num_simulations)

    return policy
```

## Expected Performance Gains

### Batch Size Scaling

| Workers | Expansions/Worker | Batch Size | GPU Util | Expected Games/Min | Speedup |
|---------|-------------------|------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| 32 | 1 (baseline) | 32 | 5% | 32 | 1.0x |
| 32 | 5 | 160 | 20% | 96 | 3.0x |
| 32 | 10 | 320 | 35% | 160 | 5.0x |
| 32 | 20 | 640 | 50% | 256 | 8.0x |
| 32 | 32 | 1024 | 60% | 320 | 10.0x |

**Target Configuration**: 32 workers × 10 expansions = 320 batch size → **5x speedup**

### Training Time Impact

| Configuration | Games/Min | Time per Iteration | 500 Iterations | Status |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Baseline** | 32 | 312 min | 108 days | 😞 Too slow |
| **Phase 1** (1.76x) | 56 | 179 min | 62 days | ⚠️ Insufficient |
| **GPU-Batched** (5x) | 160 | 62 min | **22 days** | ✅ Acceptable |
| **GPU-Batched** (10x) | 320 | 31 min | **11 days** | 🎯 Excellent |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Virtual Loss Degrades Policy Quality
**Mitigation**:
- Use small virtual loss value (0.1-1.0)
- Compare final policies vs sequential MCTS
- If >5% policy divergence, reduce expansion batch size

### Risk 2: Batch Timeout Too Long (Latency)
**Mitigation**:
- Start with 5ms timeout
- Monitor avg batch size and latency
- Tune timeout to achieve target batch size (256-512)

### Risk 3: GPU Memory Overflow
**Mitigation**:
- Cap max batch size at 1024
- Monitor VRAM usage
- RTX 4060 8GB should handle 1024 batch easily

### Risk 4: Multiprocessing + GPU Server Deadlock
**Mitigation**:
- Use dedicated GPU server process
- Worker processes only submit requests
- Test with 2 workers first, scale to 32

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Acceptable
- ✅ 5x speedup over baseline (160 games/min)
- ✅ GPU utilization 30%+
- ✅ Policy quality within 5% of sequential MCTS
- ✅ Training time <25 days for 500 iterations

### Excellent
- ✅ 10x speedup over baseline (320 games/min)
- ✅ GPU utilization 50%+
- ✅ Policy quality within 2% of sequential MCTS
- ✅ Training time <15 days for 500 iterations

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Time**: 3 weeks (conservative)
- Week 1: Core infrastructure (virtual loss, batch server, parallel expansion)
- Week 2: Integration (SelfPlayEngine, worker updates, testing)
- Week 3: Benchmarking, tuning, validation

**Aggressive Timeline**: 1 week (if no major issues)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: After Week 1 unit tests pass

## Benchmark Results & Analysis (2025-10-26)

### Quick Comparison Benchmark (5 games)

**Configuration**:
- Workers: 4
- Parallel batch size: 10
- Max batch size: 512
- Timeout: 5.0ms

**Results**:

| Configuration | Games/Min | Speedup vs Baseline | Avg Batch Size | Max Batch Size |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Baseline (Sequential) | 5.7 | 1.00x | 1.0 | 1 |
| Phase 1 (Intra-Game) | 6.8 | 1.19x | 90.0 | ~90 |
| **GPU-Batched MCTS** | **6.1** | **1.07x** | **3.3** | **4** |

**Status**: ❌ **FAILED - Slower than Phase 1**

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Average batch size of 3.3 instead of expected 40+

**Why batching failed**:
1. **Sequential determinizations**: Each worker runs 3 determinizations sequentially, not in parallel
2. **Low worker count**: Only 4 workers × 3 det = 12 MCTS instances max
3. **Tree traversal bottleneck**: MCTS tree traversal is inherently sequential
4. **Timing mismatch**: Workers don't send requests at the same time

**Expected architecture**:
```
32 workers × 3 determinizations × 10 parallel expansions = 960 concurrent requests
```

**Actual behavior**:
```
4 workers × 1 determinization at a time × 1-4 expansions = 4-16 requests (but sequential!)
```

**Key insight**: GPU-batched MCTS requires:
- **Many workers** (32+) to have enough concurrent requests
- **Parallel determinizations** (not sequential)
- **Synchronized request submission** to accumulate batches

With only 4 workers and sequential determinizations, requests arrive one-by-one, resulting in tiny batches (avg 3.3).

### Why This Approach Can't Work

**Fundamental limitation**: Cross-worker batching requires many concurrent MCTS searches

**Current constraints**:
- 4 workers (not enough parallelism)
- Sequential determinizations (1 at a time per worker)
- Sequential tree traversal (inherent to MCTS)

**To achieve target batch sizes (256-512)**:
- Need 32+ workers simultaneously in expansion phase
- Need parallel determinization execution
- Need worker synchronization (adds complexity/latency)

**Catch-22**:
- Small batches → Poor GPU utilization → Slow inference
- Large worker count → Memory pressure + coordination overhead
- Synchronization → Added latency negates benefits

### Comparison to Phase 1

**Phase 1 (Intra-Game Batching)**:
- Batches neural network calls within a single MCTS search
- Achieves batch size ~90 (3 det × 30 sims)
- Works with any worker count
- **Simpler and more effective** for our use case

**GPU-Batched MCTS (Cross-Worker)**:
- Batches across multiple MCTS searches
- Only achieves batch size 3-4 with 4 workers
- Requires 32+ workers for effectiveness
- Adds multiprocessing complexity
- **Not suitable for desktop training setup**

### Lessons Learned

1. **Cross-worker batching needs massive parallelism** (100+ workers)
   - AlphaGo used 5000 TPUs with thousands of parallel games
   - Our desktop setup (4-32 workers) is too small

2. **Intra-game batching is better for smaller scale**
   - Phase 1 already achieves good batch sizes (90)
   - Simpler architecture, no multiprocessing overhead

3. **Sequential determinizations are the bottleneck**
   - Each worker only has 1 active determinization at a time
   - Can't accumulate requests across 3 det when they run sequentially

4. **MCTS tree traversal is inherently sequential**
   - Parallel expansion helps within one search
   - But can't parallelize across different game states effectively

### Recommendations

**DO NOT DEPLOY GPU-batched MCTS**. Instead:

1. **Stick with Phase 1 (Intra-Game Batching)**
   - Already achieving 6.8 games/min (1.19x speedup)
   - Simpler architecture
   - Works with existing multiprocessing setup

2. **Investigate parallel determinizations**
   - Run 3 determinizations concurrently per worker
   - Could increase effective parallelism 3x
   - Requires ThreadPoolExecutor or async implementation

3. **Increase worker count to 32**
   - More workers = more games/min (linear scaling)
   - Don't need cross-worker batching if Phase 1 works

4. **Focus on GPU server approach (Phase 3.5)**
   - Centralized GPU server with multiprocessing workers
   - Each worker has its own network-free MCTS
   - Server batches requests from all workers
   - Simpler than parallel expansion with virtual loss

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Abandon GPU-batched parallel expansion approach**
2. ⬜ **Re-test Phase 1 with 32 workers** (should get ~50-60 games/min)
3. ⬜ **Implement GPU server architecture** (Phase 3.5 retry)
4. ⬜ **Benchmark GPU server with 32 workers**
5. ⬜ **Compare: Sequential (5.7) vs Batched (6.8) vs GPU Server (?)**

---

## Status

**Current**: ❌ **IMPLEMENTATION FAILED - APPROACH ABANDONED**
**Reason**: Cross-worker batching requires massive parallelism (100+ workers) not available on desktop setup
**Next**: Return to Phase 1 (intra-game batching) or retry GPU server approach

**Key Finding**: Intra-game batching (Phase 1) is more effective than cross-worker batching for small-scale training
