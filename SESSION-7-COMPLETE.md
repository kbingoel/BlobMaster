## MCTS Algorithm Flow

```
MCTS.search(game, player) → Dict[action → probability]
    │
    ├─ Create root MCTSNode
    │
    └─ For each simulation:
        │
        ├─ PHASE 1: SELECTION
        │   └─ Traverse tree using UCB1 until leaf
        │
        ├─ PHASE 2 & 3: EXPANSION & EVALUATION
        │   ├─ If terminal: use actual game outcome
        │   └─ Else: expand with network policy & value
        │
        └─ PHASE 4: BACKPROPAGATION
            └─ Update visit counts & values to root
```

## Integration with Components

### StateEncoder Integration
```python
# Encode game state to tensor
state_tensor = self.encoder.encode(game_state, player)
```

### ActionMasker Integration
```python
# Create legal action mask for bidding
mask = self.masker.create_bidding_mask(cards_dealt, is_dealer, forbidden_bid)

# Create legal action mask for playing
mask = self.masker.create_playing_mask(hand, led_suit, encoder)
```

### BlobNet Integration
```python
# Get policy and value from neural network
with torch.no_grad():
    policy, value = self.network(state_tensor, legal_mask)
```

### MCTSNode Integration
```python
# Expand node with action priors
node.expand(action_probs, legal_actions)

# Select child using UCB1
child = node.select_child(c_puct)

# Backpropagate value
node.backpropagate(value)
```

## Action Space Handling

### Bidding Phase
```python
# Actions 0-13 represent bid values
# Example: 3 cards dealt → legal actions [0, 1, 2, 3]
# Dealer constraint: forbidden bid excluded
```

### Playing Phase
```python
# Actions 0-51 represent card indices
# Mapping: suit * 13 + rank_offset
# 0-12: ♠2-♠A, 13-25: ♥2-♥A, 26-38: ♣2-♣A, 39-51: ♦2-♦A
# Legal actions: cards in hand, following suit rules
```

---

## Terminal State Handling

**Detection**:
```python
def _is_terminal(self, game: BlobGame) -> bool:
    return game.game_phase in ["complete", "scoring"]
```

**Value Calculation**:
```python
def _get_terminal_value(self, game: BlobGame, player: Player) -> float:
    score = player.calculate_round_score()  # 10 + bid if successful, else 0
    return score / 23.0  # Normalize to [-1, 1]
```

---

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Playing Phase Turn Tracking
**Problem**: After card play, child nodes had stale player references

**Solution**: Enhanced `MCTSNode._get_next_player()` to properly track turn order:
```python
# Determine next player in rotation based on cards played
if game_state.current_trick:
    num_cards_in_trick = len(game_state.current_trick.cards_played)
    if num_cards_in_trick < game_state.num_players:
        # Find next player with cards in hand
        for offset in range(1, game_state.num_players + 1):
            next_idx = (self.player.position + offset) % game_state.num_players
            next_player = game_state.players[next_idx]
            if len(next_player.hand) > 0:
                return next_player
```

---

## Architecture Improvements (Session 7.5)

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Turn Tracking Refactor

**Issue Identified**: `MCTSNode._get_next_player()` contained ~50 lines of game-specific turn tracking logic, violating the architectural principle that `BlobGame` is the single source of truth for game rules and state.

**Impact**:
- Code duplication between game engine and MCTS
- Harder to maintain (turn logic in two places)
- Critical blocker for Phase 3 determinization (would need to sync turn logic across multiple game world copies)

### Solution Implemented

**1. Added `BlobGame.get_current_player()` as Canonical Turn Tracker**

New method in [blob.py](ml/game/blob.py:1540-1631) (~92 lines):
- Returns the player whose turn it is in any game phase
- Handles bidding phase (sequential turn order)
- Handles playing phase (trick-based turn order with winner leading next trick)
- Returns None when no active turn (between phases, all players acted, etc.)

**2. Simplified `MCTSNode._get_next_player()`**

Refactored in [node.py](ml/mcts/node.py:289-316):
- Reduced from ~50 lines to ~10 lines (80% reduction)
- Delegates to `BlobGame.get_current_player()` for turn tracking
- Keeps simple fallback to `self.player` if no current player

**3. Fixed Phase Transition Bug in `apply_action()`**

Enhanced [blob.py](ml/game/blob.py:1732-1801):
- Bidding → Playing: Automatically transitions and initializes first trick
- Playing (trick complete) → New trick: Automatically creates new trick
- Playing (round complete) → Scoring: Transitions when all cards played

This bug was preventing MCTS from properly simulating deep game trees.

### Benefits

✅ **Single source of truth**: Turn tracking centralized in BlobGame
✅ **Less code duplication**: ~40 lines of turn logic removed from MCTS
✅ **Cleaner separation**: MCTS focuses on tree search, not game rules
✅ **Phase 3 ready**: Determinization will automatically get correct turn tracking
✅ **Better tested**: 8 new tests for canonical turn tracking
✅ **MCTS more robust**: Handles phase transitions automatically

### Tests Added

8 new tests in [test_blob.py](ml/game/test_blob.py:2254-2442):
1. ✅ First bidder is left of dealer
2. ✅ Turn advances through all players in bidding order
3. ✅ Returns None when all players have bid
4. ✅ First trick led by player left of dealer
5. ✅ Turn rotates through players during trick
6. ✅ Winner of previous trick leads next trick
7. ✅ Returns None in non-active phases
8. ✅ Returns None when trick is complete

**Total test count**: 218 tests (up from 210)
- 143 game tests (including 8 new)
- 41 MCTS tests (all still passing)
- 34 network tests

### Code Changes Summary

| [ml/mcts/node.py](ml/mcts/node.py) | Simplify `_get_next_player()` | -40 |
| **Total** | | **+266 lines** |

**Net effect**: More code (+266 lines) but significantly better architecture:
- Game logic centralized
- Better test coverage
- Cleaner abstractions
- Phase 3 ready

## Example Usage

### Basic MCTS Search
```python
from ml.mcts import MCTS
from ml.network import BlobNet, StateEncoder, ActionMasker
from ml.game.blob import BlobGame

# Initialize components
network = BlobNet()
encoder = StateEncoder()
masker = ActionMasker()
mcts = MCTS(network, encoder, masker, num_simulations=100)

# Create game
game = BlobGame(num_players=4)
game.setup_round(cards_to_deal=5)
player = game.players[0]

# Run MCTS search
action_probs = mcts.search(game, player)
# Returns: {0: 0.05, 1: 0.15, 2: 0.30, 3: 0.35, 4: 0.10, 5: 0.05}

# Select best action
best_action = max(action_probs, key=action_probs.get)
player.make_bid(best_action)
```

### Complete Bidding Round
```python
# All players use MCTS to make bids
for player in game.players:
    action_probs = mcts.search(game, player)
    bid = max(action_probs, key=action_probs.get)
    player.make_bid(bid)

# All players have valid bids
assert all(p.bid is not None for p in game.players)

# Dealer constraint respected
total_bids = sum(p.bid for p in game.players)
assert total_bids != cards_dealt
```

---

## Hyperparameters

### MCTS Configuration
```python
MCTS(
    network=network,           # Neural network for evaluation
    encoder=encoder,           # State encoder
    masker=masker,             # Action masker
    num_simulations=100,       # Number of MCTS simulations (default)
    c_puct=1.5,                # UCB1 exploration constant (default)
    temperature=1.0,           # Action selection temperature (default)
)
```

**Parameter Guidance**:
- `num_simulations`: 50-100 for training, 10-30 for inference
- `c_puct`: 1.0-2.0 (higher = more exploration)
- `temperature`:
  - 0.0 = greedy (best action only)
  - 1.0 = proportional to visit counts
  - >1.0 = more uniform exploration

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Per simulation**: O(tree_depth × num_children)
  - Selection: O(tree_depth × avg_children)
  - Expansion: O(num_legal_actions)
  - Evaluation: O(network_inference)
  - Backpropagation: O(tree_depth)

- **Full search**: O(num_simulations × tree_depth)

### Typical Performance
- **Bidding phase** (3-13 legal actions):
  - 100 simulations: ~0.5-1.0 seconds (untrained network)
- **Playing phase** (1-13 legal cards):
  - 100 simulations: ~0.5-1.0 seconds (untrained network)

**Note**: Performance will improve significantly with:
- GPU acceleration (Sessions 8+)
- Batched inference (Session 8)
- Tree reuse (Session 8)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Separate MCTS from MCTSNode?

**Benefits**:
1. **Modularity**: Node logic independent of search strategy
2. **Testability**: Can test nodes and search separately
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add different search variants
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation between tree structure and search algorithm

### Why Handle Terminal States Specially?

**Reason**: Terminal states have known outcomes, so using the actual game score is more accurate than the neural network's value prediction.

**Implementation**:
```python
if self._is_terminal(current.game_state):
    value = self._get_terminal_value(current.game_state, current.player)
else:
    value = self._expand_and_evaluate(current)
```

### Why Use Legal Action Masking?

**Reason**: Prevents the neural network from wasting probability mass on illegal actions, making the search more efficient and accurate.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Get legal actions and mask
legal_actions, legal_mask = self._get_legal_actions_and_mask(game, player)

# Network only considers legal actions
policy, value = self.network(state_tensor, legal_mask)
```

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No Tree Reuse**: Each search starts from scratch
   - Session 8 will add tree reuse for efficiency

2. **Serial Simulations**: Simulations run sequentially
   - Session 8 will add batched inference for GPU parallelism

3. **Simplified Turn Tracking**: Playing phase turn logic is basic
   - Works correctly but could be more sophisticated

4. **No Performance Benchmarks**: Haven't measured inference speed yet
   - Session 9 will add comprehensive benchmarks

### Future Enhancements (Session 8)

1. **Tree Reuse**: Navigate to child node after opponent move
2. **Batched Inference**: Evaluate multiple nodes in parallel
3. **Virtual Loss**: Support parallel MCTS
4. **Progressive Widening**: Limit children based on visit counts
