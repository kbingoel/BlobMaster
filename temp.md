I asked the following question:
All conclusions and summaries such as FINDINGS.md suggest that the real speed gains will come from "Phase 1: GPU-batched MCTS". But I thought we already implemented phase one as shown by docs/phases/PHASE1-COMPLETE.md as well as maybe SESSION-SUMMARY.md
How come even if we did this already Does the summary still believe that this is the most promising approach to go forward with? Has the summary overlooked that implementation as well as the performance report or is there something we still haven't done yet that needs to be worked out and it's gains evaluated? 
Do not create a plan, just simply create a concise explanation and answer to my question.

And got the following reply:
Looking at the documents, I can clarify the discrepancy:
The Key Issue: Phase 1 Was Implemented But Never Integrated
What actually happened:
Phase 1 was implemented (PHASE1-COMPLETE.md):
Virtual loss mechanism added to ml/mcts/node.py
Batched search method created in ml/mcts/search.py
Standalone test (ml/test_batched_phase1.py) passed and showed 90% network call reduction
BUT Phase 1 was never integrated into self-play (critical note at PHASE1-COMPLETE.md:72):
The batched search method exists but isn't being called by the actual self-play pipeline
All subsequent performance tests (Phase 2, 3, 3.5) ran without Phase 1 batching active
FINDINGS.md:158 explicitly lists this: "Phase 1 (virtual loss) achieving 10x speedup | ‚ùå Unvalidated | Tested in isolation, never validated in integrated self-play"
Current performance benchmarks (32 workers, 43 games/min):
These were measured without Phase 1 batching enabled
They represent sequential network calls (1 call per MCTS leaf node)
GPU utilization is only 15-20% because batch sizes are tiny (3-13)
Why documents still recommend GPU-batched MCTS: The recommendations are saying: "Phase 1 code exists and theoretically works, but you need to actually integrate it into the self-play pipeline and validate that the 10x speedup materializes in practice." The missing step is in PHASE1-COMPLETE.md:129-143 - modifying ml/training/selfplay.py to use search_batched() instead of search(). TL;DR: Phase 1 exists as code but was never "turned on" in the actual training pipeline. All performance measurements were done without it.

Please integrate phase one into self play and run the necessary performance benchmarks to see whether it dethrones the currently Best recommended configuration as shown in the findings.md
