# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BlobMaster is an AI-powered assistant for the card game "Blob" (trick-taking bidding game) using AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning. The project implements a neural network trained through self-play with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to master both bidding strategy and optimal card play in an imperfect information game.

**Architecture**: Training and development happen on a Linux PC (Ubuntu 24.04) with RTX 4060 GPU + Python 3.14/PyTorch. Future inference deployment (Phase 7+) may use a Windows laptop with Intel iGPU + ONNX Runtime, or may be split into a separate repository. The production stack (when implemented) uses Bun (TypeScript backend), Svelte (frontend), and SQLite (database).

## Development Environment

**IMPORTANT - Development Platform:**
- **Primary Development**: Ubuntu Linux 24.04 on Ryzen 9 7950X + RTX 4060 8GB
- **Python Version**: Python 3.14.0 (with GIL enabled)
- **Training Location**: All training happens on the Linux PC
- **Future Deployment**: Windows laptop inference is Phase 7+ (future work, may be separate repo)

## High-Level Architecture

### Three-Environment Design

1. **Training (Python/PyTorch)**: Heavy GPU computation for self-play and neural network training
2. **Inference (ONNX)**: Lightweight cross-platform model serving
3. **Production (Bun + Svelte)**: Web application that loads ONNX model for real-time gameplay

This separation allows expensive training on powerful hardware while keeping the production app lightweight and deployable on modest hardware.

### ML Pipeline (AlphaZero-Style)

**Self-Play Training Loop**:
```
Self-Play → Replay Buffer → Network Training → Evaluation → Checkpoint
    ↑                                                            |
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Self-Play**: Generate games using current model + MCTS (parallel workers)
2. **Replay Buffer**: Store (state, MCTS_policy, final_score) tuples
3. **Training**: Update neural network via supervised learning on self-play data
4. **Evaluation**: Test new model vs previous best using ELO ratings
5. **Checkpoint**: Save model if it beats previous best by >55% win rate

**Key Components**:

- **Game State Encoder**: Converts imperfect information game state → 256-dim tensor
  - Player's hand, cards played, bids, tricks won, belief state about opponent cards
  - Handles variable player counts (3-8 players) with masking

- **Neural Network**: Lightweight Transformer (~5-8M parameters)
  - Dual-head architecture: Policy head (action probabilities) + Value head (score prediction)
  - Policy head handles both bidding phase and card-playing phase
  - Legal action masking ensures only valid moves are considered

- **MCTS with Determinization**: Handles imperfect information (hidden opponent cards)
  - Sample 3-5 possible opponent hand distributions
  - Run MCTS on each sample (200-400 simulations during training, 50-100 during inference)
  - Aggregate visit counts across samples to get final action probabilities
  - Tree reuse: Navigate to child node after opponent move to keep explored subtree

- **Belief Tracking**: Maintain probability distribution over opponent cards
  - Update beliefs when players reveal information (e.g., can't follow suit → don't have that suit)
  - Critical for accurate determinization sampling

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why AlphaZero over PPO/A3C?
- **Sample efficiency**: MCTS + neural network converges faster than pure policy gradients
- **Proven for card games**: Similar architectures dominate poker (Pluribus), bridge
- **Interpretability**: MCTS tree visualizable to explain AI reasoning
- **Tree reuse**: Retain computed nodes when game state updates incrementally

### Why Transformer over CNN?
- Better at modeling card relationships (no spatial locality assumption)
- Handles variable-length game states naturally (3-8 players, different rounds)
- Self-attention captures interactions between cards, bids, and trick history

### Why Determinization for Imperfect Information?
- Standard MCTS assumes perfect information (all cards visible)
- Determinization: Sample multiple possible worlds consistent with observations
- Average MCTS results across samples approximates Bayesian belief state
- Belief tracking updates: When player doesn't follow suit, eliminate that suit from their possible cards

### Why Bun + Svelte (not Python Flask/FastAPI)?
- **Faster startup**: No Python interpreter overhead
- **Single binary**: Easier deployment on laptop
- **File-based storage**: SQLite in repo directory (no separate database server)
- **Better inference performance**: ONNX Runtime optimized for production, OpenVINO uses Intel iGPU
- **Modern stack**: TypeScript end-to-end for type safety

## Game Rules (Blob Variant)

Understanding the game is crucial for debugging AI behavior:

- **Bidding**: Players bid sequentially on exact number of tricks they'll win
  - **Last bidder constraint**: Dealer cannot bid such that total bids = cards dealt (creates strategic tension)
- **Playing**: Standard trick-taking with trump suit
  - Must follow suit if possible
  - Trump beats non-trump, highest card in led suit wins otherwise
  - Winner leads next trick
- **Scoring**: All-or-nothing: `score = (tricks_won == bid) ? (10 + bid) : 0`
  - Exact trick count required for points
  - Creates high-stakes decisions and rewards accurate self-assessment

```

### Training Configuration System

The project uses a centralized configuration system via `ml/config.py`:

**Built-in configs:**
```python
from ml.config import TrainingConfig, get_fast_config, get_production_config

# Production config (3-7 day training)
config = get_production_config()

# Fast config (quick testing)
config = get_fast_config()  # Fewer games, workers, simulations

# Custom config
config = TrainingConfig(
    num_workers=16,
    games_per_iteration=10000,
    batch_size=512,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    # ... see ml/config.py for all options
)
```

**Key parameters:**
- `num_workers`: Parallel self-play workers (default: 16)
- `games_per_iteration`: Games per training iteration (default: 10,000)
- `num_determinizations`: Worlds sampled for imperfect info (default: 3)
- `simulations_per_determinization`: MCTS simulations per world (default: 30)
- `batch_size`: Training batch size (default: 512)
- `replay_buffer_capacity`: Experience replay size (default: 500,000)
- `eval_games`: Games for model evaluation (default: 400)
- `promotion_threshold`: Win rate to promote new model (default: 0.55)

**Using configs:**
```bash
# Use fast config via CLI
venv/Scripts/python.exe ml/train.py --fast --iterations 5

# Load from JSON file
venv/Scripts/python.exe ml/train.py --config my_config.json --iterations 100
```

### When Modifying Game Rules
1. Update `ml/game/blob.py` (Python source of truth)
2. Add unit tests to verify rule changes
3. Re-train model from scratch (rules changes invalidate old training data)
4. Port rule changes to TypeScript backend (`backend/src/game/`) when implementing Phase 6

### When Debugging AI Behavior
1. **Check belief tracking**: Are opponent cards being deduced correctly?
2. **Visualize MCTS tree**: What actions is AI considering? Visit counts?
3. **Compare determinizations**: Are sampled worlds consistent with observations?
4. **Verify legal action masking**: Is network only outputting valid moves?
5. **ELO progression**: Is model improving over iterations? Plateauing?

### When Optimizing Inference Performance
- **Reduce MCTS simulations**: 50-100 for laptop inference vs 200-400 for training
- **Batch neural network calls**: Amortize model overhead across multiple MCTS leaf evaluations
- **OpenVINO optimization**: Use Intel-specific optimizations for iGPU
- **ONNX graph optimization**: Operator fusion, constant folding

## Performance Findings & Training Configuration

After extensive performance testing (see [PERFORMANCE-FINDINGS.md](PERFORMANCE-FINDINGS.md)), we determined the optimal configuration:

**Best Configuration** (Phase 2 - Baseline Multiprocessing):
```bash
python ml/train.py --workers 32 --device cuda
```

**Expected Performance** (Windows baseline benchmarks):
- Light MCTS (2 det × 20 sims): 80 games/min
- Medium MCTS (3 det × 30 sims): 43 games/min ← **recommended for training**
- Heavy MCTS (5 det × 50 sims): 25 games/min

**Linux Performance** (Ubuntu 24.04 + RTX 4060, current):
- Medium MCTS (3 det × 30 sims): **20 games/min** (2.2x slower than Windows baseline!)
- GPU-Batched MCTS (experimental): 8.8 games/min (avg batch size: 2.8, needs optimization)
- Intra-Game Batching: 9.9 games/min (1.5x speedup over sequential)

**Training Timeline** (500 iterations × 10,000 games each):
- Medium MCTS @ 20 games/min: **~120 days continuous training** (vs 54 days expected)
- GPU utilization: 15-20% (acceptable for MCTS sequential nature)
- **⚠️ Performance Investigation Needed**: Linux slower than expected, root cause unknown

**Key Findings**:
- GPU server architecture (Phase 3.5) failed: 3-5x slower due to small batch sizes
- Threading + batching failed: GIL contention and overhead exceeded benefits
- Simple multiprocessing wins: 32 workers with per-worker networks
- **Linux performance regression**: 2.2x slower than Windows baseline (needs investigation)
- GPU-batched MCTS: Small batch sizes (2.8 avg) limit speedup potential

**Detailed Analysis**: See [docs/performance/](docs/performance/) for comprehensive investigation

## Expected Training Progression

Based on similar AlphaZero projects:

- **Day 1** (ELO ~800): Random legal moves
- **Day 3** (ELO ~1200): Learned basic trick-taking rules
- **Day 7** (ELO ~1600): Strategic bidding and card counting
- **~50 days total** on RTX 4060 for strong model (with Medium MCTS)

**Hardware Requirements**:
- **Training** (Linux PC): RTX 4060 8GB GPU, Ryzen 9 7950X 16-core, 128GB DDR5 RAM, 50GB+ storage
- **Inference** (future, Windows laptop): Intel i5-1135G7, iGPU, 16GB RAM, <500ms latency target

## Research Questions Being Explored

1. **Strategy convergence**: Do models converge to same optimal play, or do initial conditions create different "styles"?
2. **Imperfect player exploitation**: Can AI exploit suboptimal human play patterns?
3. **Position value**: Is last bidder position advantageous (information) or disadvantageous (constraint)?
4. **Risk/reward bidding**: Conservative vs aggressive bidding strategies
5. **Belief state accuracy**: How quickly can AI deduce opponent hands?
6. **Transfer learning**: Can 4-player model adapt to 6-player games?

## Common Pitfalls

### MCTS with Imperfect Information
- **Don't** run MCTS on current state with unknown opponent cards → will make incorrect assumptions
- **Do** sample multiple determinizations first, then run MCTS on each

### Legal Action Masking
- **Don't** let neural network output probabilities for invalid actions (e.g., playing card not in hand)
- **Do** apply masking layer that zeros out invalid actions before softmax

### Belief State Updates
- **Don't** assume uniform distribution over unseen cards → ignores revealed information
- **Do** track information sets: when player doesn't follow suit, remove that suit from their possible cards

### Training Data Quality
- **Don't** train only on games from early iterations → model will overfit to weak play
- **Do** maintain replay buffer with recent games (last 500k positions)

### ONNX Export Validation
- **Don't** assume ONNX output matches PyTorch without testing
- **Do** compare outputs on 100+ random states to verify numerical equivalence
