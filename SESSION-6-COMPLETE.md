**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented the MCTS tree node structure with UCB1 selection, tree expansion, backpropagation, and action selection. This provides the foundation for the full MCTS search algorithm that will be implemented in Session 7.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. MCTSNode Class ✅

**Core Functionality**: Complete MCTS tree node with all required operations

**Key Features**:
- **UCB1 Selection**: Balances exploration vs exploitation using AlphaZero-style formula
- **Tree Expansion**: Creates children by simulating actions using `BlobGame.copy()` and `apply_action()`
- **Backpropagation**: Recursively updates visit counts and values up to root
- **Action Selection**: Converts visit counts to action probabilities with temperature control

**Implementation Details**:
- ~400 lines of well-documented code
- Full integration with Phase 1 game engine
- Type hints on all methods
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples

**File**: [ml/mcts/node.py](ml/mcts/node.py) (404 lines)

---

## Key Methods Implemented

### Node State Management

1. **`__init__(...)`**: Initialize node with game state, player, parent, action, prior
2. **`is_leaf()`**: Check if node has been expanded
3. **`is_root()`**: Check if node is root (no parent)

### UCB1 Selection

4. **`select_child(c_puct)`**: Select child with highest UCB1 score
5. **`_ucb1_score(child, c_puct)`**: Compute UCB1 formula: `Q + c_puct × P × sqrt(N_parent) / (1 + N_child)`

### Tree Expansion

6. **`expand(action_probs, legal_actions)`**: Create children for all legal actions
7. **`_simulate_action(action)`**: Use `BlobGame.copy()` + `apply_action()` to create child state
8. **`_get_next_player(game_state)`**: Determine whose turn it is after action

### Backpropagation

9. **`backpropagate(value)`**: Update visit count, total value, mean value, and propagate to parent

### Action Selection

10. **`get_action_probabilities(temperature)`**: Convert visit counts → action probabilities
11. **`select_action(temperature)`**: Sample action from visit count distribution

---

## UCB1 Formula

The node implements the AlphaZero-style UCB1 formula:

```
UCB(child) = Q + c_puct × P × sqrt(N_parent) / (1 + N_child)

Where:
- Q = child.mean_value           (exploitation term)
- P = child.prior_prob           (from neural network policy)
- N_parent = parent.visit_count  (parent visits)
- N_child = child.visit_count    (child visits)
- c_puct = exploration constant  (typically 1.5)
```

**Behavior**:
- Unvisited children get high exploration bonus (N_child = 0)
- High-value children (Q) are preferred (exploitation)
- High-prior children (P) are preferred initially
- Exploration bonus decreases as child is visited more

---

## Temperature Control

Action selection supports temperature parameter for controlling exploration:

```python
temperature = 0.0   # Greedy: always select most visited action
temperature = 1.0   # Proportional: sample based on visit counts
temperature = 2.0   # More uniform: increased exploration
```

Formula: `visits^(1/temp) / sum(visits^(1/temp))`

---

## Integration with Phase 1 Game Engine

The node successfully integrates with existing game infrastructure:

### Using `BlobGame.copy()` (Phase 1a.10)
```python
def _simulate_action(self, action: int) -> BlobGame:
    # Create deep copy of game state
    new_game = self.game_state.copy()

    # Find corresponding player in copied game
    copied_player = new_game.players[self.player.position]

    # Apply action to the copy
    new_game.apply_action(action, copied_player)

    return new_game
```

### Using `BlobGame.apply_action()` (Phase 1a.10)
- **Bidding phase**: action is bid value (0-13)
- **Playing phase**: action is card index (0-51)
  - 0-12: ♠2-♠A
  - 13-25: ♥2-♥A
  - 26-38: ♣2-♣A
  - 39-51: ♦2-♦A

## Coverage Analysis

**96% coverage on node.py** - Missing lines:
- Line 155: Edge case in player turn detection
- Lines 312-316: Alternative path in `_get_next_player`
- Line 390: Edge case in action selection

These are defensive code paths that will be covered by integration tests in Session 7.

## Example Usage

### Basic Node Operations
```python
from ml.mcts import MCTSNode
from ml.game.blob import BlobGame

# Create game
game = BlobGame(num_players=4)
game.setup_round(cards_to_deal=5)
player = game.players[0]

# Create root node
root = MCTSNode(game, player)

# Expand node
action_probs = {0: 0.2, 1: 0.3, 2: 0.5}  # From neural network
legal_actions = [0, 1, 2]
root.expand(action_probs, legal_actions)

# Select child using UCB1
root.visit_count = 1  # Mark root as visited
child = root.select_child(c_puct=1.5)

# Backpropagate value
child.backpropagate(0.8)

# Get action probabilities
probs = root.get_action_probabilities(temperature=1.0)
# {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 1.0}  # Action 2 was selected

# Select final action
action = root.select_action(temperature=1.0)
```

### Tree Structure
```
root (visits=2, value=0.4)
├── child[0] (visits=0, value=0.0, prior=0.2)
├── child[1] (visits=0, value=0.0, prior=0.3)
└── child[2] (visits=1, value=0.8, prior=0.5)  ← selected
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why UCB1 from AlphaZero?

Traditional MCTS uses UTC (Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees):
```
UCT = Q + sqrt(2 * ln(N_parent) / N_child)
```

AlphaZero uses a modified formula incorporating neural network priors:
```
UCB1 = Q + c_puct * P * sqrt(N_parent) / (1 + N_child)
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Prior knowledge**: Leverages neural network policy to guide search
2. **Faster convergence**: Explores promising moves first
3. **Proven performance**: Used in AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero
4. **Tunable exploration**: `c_puct` parameter controls exploration

### Why Temperature for Action Selection?

Temperature allows flexible action selection:
- **Training** (early): High temperature for exploration
- **Training** (late): Low temperature for exploitation
- **Inference**: Temperature=0 for best move

This is critical for self-play training in Phase 4.

### Why Separate Node from Search?

Separating `MCTSNode` from `MCTS` search:
1. **Modularity**: Node logic independent of search algorithm
2. **Testability**: Can test nodes in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Nodes can be reused across searches (tree reuse)
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns

Session 7 will implement `MCTS` class that orchestrates nodes with neural network.

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- Each node: ~200 bytes (game state reference + statistics)
- Tree with 1000 nodes: ~200KB
- Typical MCTS search (100 sims): ~10-50 nodes

### Time Complexity
- `select_child()`: O(num_children) - typically 6-13 for bidding, 1-13 for playing
- `expand()`: O(num_actions) - creates children
- `backpropagate()`: O(tree_depth) - typically 20-50 for full game

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Simplified Turn Tracking**: `_get_next_player()` uses basic logic
   - Will be enhanced in Session 7 with full game state tracking

2. **No Terminal State Detection**: Nodes don't detect game end
   - Will be added in Session 7 MCTS search

3. **No Tree Reuse**: Can't reuse subtrees across moves
   - Will be implemented in Session 8 optimization

### Future Enhancements (Session 7-8)

1. **Virtual Loss**: Prevent threads from exploring same path in parallel MCTS
2. **Progressive Widening**: Limit children based on visit counts
3. **RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation)**: Cross-tree action statistics
4. **Tree Reuse**: Navigate to child node after opponent move
